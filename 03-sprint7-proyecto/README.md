## Description
Engineered and deployed an interactive web application using Streamlit and Plotly Express. This project demonstrates end-to-end software engineering skills, including virtual environment management, dynamic EDA dashboards, and continuous cloud deployment via Render.

### **Project Objective**

The goal was to develop an interactive web tool that allows users to explore patterns in car sales advertisements. The application facilitates the dynamic visualization of mileage distribution, pricing, and vehicle condition through modern web components.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Visualization:** Plotly Express
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Cloud Deployment:** Render
- **Environment:** VS Code & Pip/Requirements

### **Key Features**

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Developed buttons and checkboxes to generate charts on demand, optimizing application performance and user experience.
- **Dynamic EDA:** Real-time generation of histograms for mileage (odometer) and scatter plots to analyze the correlation between price and vehicle status.
- **Software Architecture:** Organized the project following industry best practices (use of `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore` files, and a structured directory for notebooks and scripts).

### **Deployment & Access**

The application was successfully deployed on **Render**, directly linked to a GitHub repository to enable Continuous Integration (CI/CD).
